# Esoteric Physics (EP) TOE Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Esoteric Physics (EP)**, my independent research project as an IT specialist and AI developer (30+ years experience). This TOE – **\( EP = Sc + Hf + \text{absbf}(0) \)** – models the universe as 99.9% deterministic, validated through AI and quantum simulations.

[LinkedIn: marcel-borer-schf0](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-borer-schf0) – schf0 encodes Sc + Hf + 0.

## Core Formula
EP = Sc + Hf + {absbf}(0)

- **Sc (Science)**: Empirical fields (physics, astrophysics, quantum mechanics).
- **Hf (Human Factor)**: Supervariable (sociology, philosophy, emergent chaos; Hafnium-symbolic).
- **absbf(0)**: Static null – singularity fallback, double superposition (alpha/omega).

Hf diverges in complexity → absbf(0) resets to stable 0, proving 99.9% predictability.

## Features
- Python scripts for classical Hf-divergence simulations.
- Quantum-ready (Qiskit/Cirq): Hf as noisy qubits, absbf(0) as collapse/reset.
- arXiv companion (physics.gen-ph): Code validates TOE preprint.
